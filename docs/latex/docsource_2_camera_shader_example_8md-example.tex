Creates a camera that can render objects. This class creates a Uniform Buffer Object you can use to get projection and view matrix data. This UBO will always be at binding point 0, and the block should always be called \char`\"{}\+Camera\+Matrices\char`\"{} in the shader.

This example showcases a basic perspective projection shader.
